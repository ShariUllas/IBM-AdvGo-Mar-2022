interfaces
functional programming
concurrency

interfaces
    implementation is 'implicit'
    

Higher Order functions
    Functions that can be treated like 'data'
        Functions can be assigned to variables
        Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions
        Functions can be returned as return values by other functions

Concurrency
    Golang is built FOR concurrency
    go, select, range, chan (data type), <- (channel operator)

    DO NOT ASSUME:
        1. the time taken for a goroutine to complete
        2. the order in which goroutines invoked / complete

    To detect race conditions
        go run --race demo-06.go 
        
        go build --race demo-06.go


    channel
        //create
        ch := make(chan int)

        //send data 
        ch <- 100

        //receive data
        <- ch

    Receive operation is ALWAYS a blocking operation

    Send operation is blocked until a Receive operation is initiated

Assignment-01:
    modify demo-20.go to generate the prime numbers until the user hits ENTER key
        NOTE: do NOT capture the ENTER key from the genPrimes function

Resource Pooling
    Create a pool with a size & factory

    Acquire Resource from the pool
        if there are resources in the pool
            return from the pool
        else
            use the factory to create the resource and return it

    Release Resource to the pool
        if the pool is full
            discard the resource
        else
            add the resource to the pool

    IMPORTANT:
        1. the factory should be thread-safe
        2. the pool should be thread-safe
        3. When a resource is acquired, it should not be allowed to be acquired again until it is released
